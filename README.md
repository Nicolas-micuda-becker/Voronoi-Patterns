# Voronoi-Patterns
This project transforms an input image into a Voronoi-based version using circles.   The algorithm partitions the image into regions based on pixel colors, creating a visual effect inspired by Voronoi diagrams.   The rendering is handled using GL4D, while SDL2 is used for window and BMP image management.
